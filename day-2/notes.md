### Solidity Best Practices

- Always use a fixed version of the Solidity compiler once it's tested and ready to be deployed. This ensures consistency and avoids unexpected issues due to compiler changes.

- Avoid using modifiers to modify the state, except when it's necessary for specific cases. Modifiers should generally be used for checks and conditions, not for changing state variables.

- Emit an event every time you change the state. This provides a clear and transparent history of state changes, making it easier to track and debug contract behavior.

- Understand the differences between `storage`, `memory`, and `calldata` in terms of variable locations and mutability. Use `storage` for persistent storage, `memory` for temporary modifiable data, and `calldata` for temporary read-only data.

- Differentiate between `constant` and `immutable` variables. `constant` variables are defined at compile-time and cannot be changed, while `immutable` variables can be defined until the constructor is executed.

- Consider using custom error messages instead of `require` for better user experience. Custom errors can provide more meaningful information to users and improve contract usability.

- Use `import` statements to import external contracts and libraries, similar to copy-pasting all the code in the file. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.

- If using enums, make use of `enum.min` and `enum.max` to ensure you handle all possible enum values correctly.

- Avoid using `selfdestruct` as it has been deprecated. It was previously used for contract destruction, but now it's discouraged due to potential misuse and security risks.

- Remember that miners choose transactions, and they have the authority to include transactions in their blocks and decide their order. Make sure your contract logic can handle this variability to ensure reliable behavior.
