Put a fix version of solidity compiler once its tested and ready to be deployed

Don't use modifier to modify state (except specific needs)

Emit an event every time you change the state

storage / memory (temporary modifiable) / calldata (temporary readonly)
constant (defined compile time) / immutable (can be define till constructor())
